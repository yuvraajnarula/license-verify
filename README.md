## License Nahi Bnaya, Toh Ghar Par Rehna

### Our Product 
Problem: One of the main causes of traffic accidents is driving without a license. It is not humanly possible to check the licenses of all drivers considering that there are 1.09 crore cars in Delhi NCR alone. Our idea aims to solve this problem
Solution: Our solution is as simple as can be. We propose to develop an app where users register their car and connect their phone to the car at the time of ignition. Then the driver should verify himself with his fingerprint, which should be matched with the driver's license database.
